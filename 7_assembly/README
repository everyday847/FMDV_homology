# We have two options for constructing models of the full RNA, based on 
# which secondary structure we assume for the J-arm. (That is: can we
# assume the exact same secondary structure as EMCV, but with a slight
# re-threading, or is the secondary structure different and we need to
# model two junctions (regions 4 and 5)?)
