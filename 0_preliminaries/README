# Preliminary notes
#
# Rosetta simulations are computationally intensive and should be executed on a
# cluster of CPUs. The simulations conducted for this study required ~20,000
# CPU-hours but a plausible reproduction could probably be conducted in ~2,000.
#
# Any stepwise or rna_denovo command line displayed below can be parallelized 
# with MPI: just compile Rosetta using scons and extras=mpi,serialization. Each
# stepwise simulation can produce about six models per CPU-day; each rna_denovo
# simulation can produce sixty to one hundred models per CPU-day.
