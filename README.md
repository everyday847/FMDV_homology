# FMDV_homology
Files supporting a protocol for FMDV homology modeling from EMCV

# Details
If you have access to Rosetta -- academic software for biomolecular modeling, with programs especially suited to RNA structure modeling -- you may wish to follow along with the attached inputs and annotated executable scripts.

If you don't have access to Rosetta, catch up -- if you're interested in this topic, you should get modeling with Rosetta! The academic license is free and the commercial license is priced in a manner I am told is compassionate towards small startups.
